		<h2>- Interacting With The GUI</h2>
		<p>
			The GUI has various elements that can be used to enhance<br/>
			the experience that otherwise may not be super apparent.
			<ul>
				<li>
					Click on the top left corner of the in-game window (where<br/>
					it says "Player #") and a new GUI will appear. This 'Player<br/>
					Stats' window gives more detailed information about each<br/>
					player and the properties they own.
				</li>
				<br/>
				<li>
					When you own a property (which is indicated by the color<br/>
					that matches the current player's color) you can left<br/>
					click on it to display additional options including the<br/>
					ability to mortage a property and add/remove upgrades<br/>
					from each property. This menu is only accessable when<br/> 
					the "Roll" button is on the screen.
				</li>

# SER216 Project
Here we go again.

This game simulates the popular board game Monopoly. The game is mostly written in Java, and uses Lua scripts to control certain actions in the game. Clone the game and then the project can be opened as an IDEA project.



## Bugs In Progress
* The game cannot be won in its current state (in progress)
* Player's pieces and properties are not removed after they go bankrupt (in progress)
* Player's don't always roll while in jail
* No option to use a get out of jail card [always used by default]
* Multiple chance/community chest cards are broken

## Bugs Fixed
* All mutator methods in Player now handle inputs appropriately [all unit tests pass now]

## Enhancements
* Color code Players and Properties
* Allow Players to select their piece at the start of the game
* Fix/add the functionality to place houses and hotels on properties
* Add a button that displays all of your opponents and properties
